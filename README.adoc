    0.94   12/22/2015  Teensy 3.x support on Serial2
    0.95   12/23/2015  Refactoring
                       Data types added: GPS, date/time, 6b, 30b
    0.96   02/21/2016  comPort number as optional parameter for Teensy in Start(...)
                       sensor device id as optional parameter (SetDeviceId(...))
                       new sample program: JetiExSimple (stripped down to the essential things)
    0.97   02/26/2016  runs w/o EX sensors (Jetibox only), see sample "JetiNoxEX"
    0.98   04/09/2016  slightly improved sensor packet size calculation (avoids "flickering" values)
    0.99   06/05/2016  max number of sensors increased to 32 
                          (set MAX_SENSOR to a higher value in JetiExProtocol.h if you need more)
                       bug with TYPE_6b removed
                       DemoSensor delivers 18 demo values now
    1.00   01/29/2017  Some refactoring:
                       - Bugixes for Jetibox keys and morse alarms (Thanks to Ingmar !)
                       - Optimized half duplex control for AVR CPUs in JetiExHardwareSerialInt class (for improved Jetibox key handling)
                       - Reduced size of serial transmit buffer (128-->64 words) 
                       - Changed bitrates for serial communication for AVR CPUs (9600-->9800 bps)
                       - EX encryption removed, as a consequence: new manufacturer ID: 0xA409
                         *** Telemetry setup in transmitter must be reconfigured (telemetry reset) ***
                       - Delay at startup increased (to give receiver more init time)
                       - New HandleMenu() function in JetiexSensor.ini (including more alarm test)
                       - JETI_DEBUG and BLOCKING_MODE removed (cleanup)
    1.01   02/15/2017  Support for ATMega32u4 CPU in Leonardo/Pro Micro

                       GetKey routine optimized
    1.02   03/28/2017  New sensor memory management. Sensor data can be located in PROGMEM

    1.03   07/14/2017  Allow all jetibox key combinations (thanks to ThomasL)
                       Disable RX at startup to prevent reception of receiver identification
                       Send dictionary already in serial initialization for the 1st time
                         in order to improve behaviour on telemetry reset
    1.04   07/18/2017  dynamic sensor de-/activation
    1.05   11/12/2017  send 3 textframes before start of EX transmission to get transmitter ready
    1.06   02/14/2021  enhance interface / implementation for priorized sensor send capabilities (SetSensorValue(id, value, prio))
                       to avoid deffered transmission of high prio data (vario). 
    1.07   02/18/2021  fixed priorized sensor implementation and added interface to speed up frame send cycle (SetJetiSendCycle(aTime)) 
    1.08   02/28/2021  - bug fix: ex buffer overrun for sensor ids >15 fixed (forced strange behaviour in prio handling)
                       - some more index size checks
                       - simplified code for prio data handling
                       - handling of -1 as invalid data removed, due to dynamic prio (SetSensorValue(..., prio) and SetSensorActive() 
                         interface
